# Time_calculation_system_according_to_coordinates
A system that, within a PLC program, makes coordinate inputs to find the local time and time zone in the specified region.

The system requires different modules to execute the specified algorithm in the form of accurate measurements.
Although this varies within the scope of the PLC and modules you use, it should basically be in communication with an external presentation or API.
